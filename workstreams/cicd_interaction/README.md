# Workstream CICD Interactions (CI Robots)
## Intro
CICD pipelines integrate the technical process and can reach from the code commit to the production deployment. Most often form follows function, especially in corporations where many processes need additional integration. Also, many outputs of a CICD are spread around various systems e.g., for testing, compliance/policy conformance and so on. However, there are extensions/supporting tools serving the pipelines before & after:
- [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot)
- [K8s-CI-Robot](https://github.com/k8s-ci-robot) as part of the CI
- [Robotframework](https://robotframework.org/)
- [Lighthouse](https://github.com/jenkins-x/lighthouse)
- [BotKube](https://www.botkube.io/)

## Workstream Focus
The workstream will focus on a Robot Interface for Git and CI tools to allow a universal integration, "human" interaction and steering capability. 
This mainly goes into the direction of tasks before and after the pipelines running. However, they can also develop the capability to intercept processes and request further input or give output.
In broader sense, the workstream can also include ChatOps approaches.

## Objectives
The group creates designs, specifications, shared code, and processes to enable the human <-> CI/CD interaction. 
 
Initial targets:

- Identify thought leadership (e.g. ProwBot) and further current implementations
- Identify relevant processes and interactions (e.g. labeling, notification, retrigger, chatops)
- Clarify terminology and define a specification

It is expected that the objectives of the workstream will move along with the shaping and discovery of these topics.
